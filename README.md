# Gradescope TA Tracking App

**Status:** 🚧 In development (March 2025 – Present)

A Python application that uses Selenium to automate data collection from Gradescope, enabling real-time tracking and visualization of Teaching Assistant (TA) grading progress. This tool helps identify workload imbalances and optimize grading efficiency within academic teams.

## 🚀 Purpose

This tool was designed to support instructors and course staff in managing TA workflows by:

- Monitoring grading progress across assignments
- Identifying discrepancies in grading workloads
- Providing visual insights to support equitable task distribution

Prototype testing revealed discrepancies of up to **25%** in grading workloads across TAs, highlighting the need for transparent workload tracking.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🔍 Automated data scraping from Gradescope using Selenium
- 📊 Basic progress visualization (e.g., per-TA grading breakdowns)
- ⚠️ Detection of workload imbalances

*More features (e.g., historical analysis, dashboard views) coming soon.*

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Selenium** (web scraping)
- **Pandas / Matplotlib** (data handling & visualization — planned)

## 📌 Installation & Setup (coming soon)

A setup guide and requirements will be added once the tool reaches MVP.

## 📂 Project Status

This app is currently under development. Future plans include:
- CLI and GUI interfaces
- Integration with Google Sheets / CSV exports
- Configurable grading benchmarks
